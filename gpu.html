    Despite the name, the GPU dosen't just handle graphics. While the CPU
    is good at doing things over and over again in a sequence, which is good
    for reading and running instrucions and programs. The GPU is good at doing 
    alot of things all at once, like drawing 4 million pixiles 120 times every
    second (FPS: frames per second). But it's also good for things like simulations
    or traing AI because you need to do many tasks all at once. You may be wondering
    why we can't just have the cpu multi task and it's because in order to achive this
    GPUs are massive, power hungry, loud, and exspinsive. For reference a decent CPU is
    about $260 while a high end GPU is over $2,000! And pulls over 60 watts; 20volts 
    3amps, yikes. But you can't ignore the binifits becaues even with a low end gpu 
    you can get a at least 40% performance increase!
