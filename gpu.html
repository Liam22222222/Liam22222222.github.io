    Despite the name, the GPU doesn't just handle graphics. While the CPU
    is good at doing things over and over again in a sequence, which is good
    for reading and running instructions and programs. The GPU is good at doing
    a lot of things all at once, like drawing 4 million pixels 120 times every
    second (FPS: frames per second). But it's also good for things like simulations
    or training AI because you need to do many tasks all at once. You may be wondering
    why we can't just have the cpu multi task and it's because in order to achieve this
    GPUs are massive, power hungry, loud, and expensive. For reference a decent CPU is
    about $260 while a high end GPU is over $2,000! And pulls over 60 watts; 20 volts
    3 amps, yikes. But you can't ignore the benefits because even with a low end gpu
    you can get at least a 40% performance increase!
